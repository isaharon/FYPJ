Contain gather_data.py, for gathering dataset from an input directory, and load_data.py, for checking the dataset shape and to verify its correctness by looking in its array.

python3 gather_data.py -i <input_dir> -o <output_filename> [-h for help]
python3 load_data.py <.npz file>

Full\ Method/ - Gathers the data pair without skipping any files
Sampling\ Method/ - Simulates a 2% sampling rate of collection by skipping 50 files/collection
Skip\ 5\ Method - Skips 5 files/collection

These methods were used to vary the training data, X, while having a sizeable amount of training label, Y, for the neural network to train on without feeding too much noise which could possibly lead to undesired results.
